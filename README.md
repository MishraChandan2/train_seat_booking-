Problem Description:
There are 80 seats in a coach of a train with only 7 seats in a row and last row of only 3 seats. For simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
If a person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way that the nearby seats are booked.
User can book as many tickets as s/he wants until the coach is full.
